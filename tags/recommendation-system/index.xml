Github repo Overview Spotify is an online music streaming service with over 140 million active users and over 30 million tracks. One of its popular features is the ability to create playlists, and the service currently hosts over 2 billion playlists.
This year&amp;rsquo;s challenge focuses on music recommendation, specifically the challenge of automatic playlist continuation. By suggesting appropriate songs to add to a playlist, a recommender system can increase user engagement by making playlist creation easier, as well as extending listening beyond the end of existing playlists.</description></item></channel></rss>
